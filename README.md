compiling
---------
You need to have installed the libraries libncursesw5-dev and libssl-dev.

It should contain the files 

	ncursesw/panel.h
	ncursesw/ncurses.h

and appropriate library files.

Then invoke:

	make install

This will create a program called 'f-irc'.

Usage
-----
Invoke:

	man f-irc

for details how to configure and use it.
